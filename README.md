# MyReads Project

This game was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

# How to Load the App

You can run a hosted version of the app at https://sharp-poitras-061bdf.netlify.com/

The project uses `Node.js` and the `Create-React-App` starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: Node.js

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

`git clone https://github.com/moumen-soliman/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git`

`cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter`

`npm i` OR `yarn`

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

`npm run start` OR `yarn start`

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
